# Stabilizing_videos_using_python

The overall purpose of this project is to do a comparision between the pretrained and custom video stabilization using deep learning. 

steps involving as of now:-
1) As a first part the process involves training a model using datasets of same videos with and without stabilizations.
2) In the second part of the project I will be using a pretrained model form some libraries.

There are different types of video datasets available for stabilization processes, depending on the specific application and use case. Here are some examples:

Handheld camera datasets: These datasets consist of videos captured by handheld cameras, which often suffer from camera shake and other types of motion that can be corrected using video stabilization techniques.

Drone and aerial datasets: These datasets consist of videos captured by drones or other aerial vehicles, which may experience motion due to wind or other environmental factors.

Action and sports datasets: These datasets consist of videos of people engaged in various types of physical activities, such as running, jumping, and playing sports. These videos may have a lot of motion and require stabilization to be easily viewed.

Surveillance and security datasets: These datasets consist of videos captured by surveillance cameras or security cameras. These videos may have motion due to people or objects moving through the frame, and may require stabilization to improve their clarity and usefulness for analysis.

Virtual reality and 360-degree datasets: These datasets consist of videos captured using virtual reality or 360-degree cameras. These videos may require stabilization to prevent motion sickness in viewers or to improve their visual quality.

Medical datasets: These datasets consist of videos captured during medical procedures or examinations, such as endoscopy or ultrasound imaging. These videos may require stabilization to improve their clarity and diagnostic accuracy.

These are just a few examples of the different types of video datasets available for stabilization processes. The choice of dataset will depend on the specific application and goals of the video stabilization process.
