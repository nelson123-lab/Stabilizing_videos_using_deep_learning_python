# Stabilizing_videos_using_python

The overall purpose of this project is to do a comparision between the pretrained and custom video stabilization using deep learning. 

steps involving as of now:-
1) As a first part the process involves training a model using datasets of same videos with and without stabilizations.
2) In the second part of the project I will be using a pretrained model form some libraries.
